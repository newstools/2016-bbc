Some 145 child soldiers fighting for two rebel groups in South Sudan have been released, Unicef has announced. The children were recruited by the Cobra Faction and the SPLA In Opposition, two armed groups which have been fighting the government. They were freed in the eastern region of Pibor and "disarmed and provided with civilian clothes," Unicef said in a statement. About 16,000 children are still in "armed groups", it says.

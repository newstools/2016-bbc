It is not clear when the video was shot but the incident has opened old wounds, with some likening it to the torture black people endured at the height of white minority rule here. But is South Africa more racially divided now? The South African Human Rights Commission does not believe so but adds that more cases are being reported - mainly because social media has helped break the silence and made it easier for people to share their stories. The commission has also found that people are more educated about their rights and what recourse they can take. As a result of the well-reported incidents in the media, South Africa is in the process of introducing specific laws to prosecute race related crimes.

A parliament session in Kenya has descended into chaos, with rival MPs trading punches. Opposition lawmakers tried to block discussions on the introduction of manual vote-counting for next year's presidential election.

After an earlier highly charged discussion over the proposed changes to the electoral law, opposition MP Millie Odhiambo attacked President Uhuru Kenyatta, calling him "extremely stupid".
